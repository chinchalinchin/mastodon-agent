.. epigraph::

    00. One is the Magus; twain His forces; four His weapons. These are the Seven Spirits of Unrighteousness; seven vultures of evil. Thus is the art and craft of the Magus but glamour. How shall He destroy Himself?

    0. Yet the Magus hath power upon the Mother both directly and through Love. And the Magus is Love, and bindeth together That and This in his conjuration.

    1. In the beginning doth the Magus speak Truth, and send forth Illusion and Falsehood to enslave the soul. Yet therein is the Mystery of Redemption.

    2. By His Wisdom made He the Worlds; the Word that is God is none other than He.

    3. How then shall He end His speech with Silence? For He is Speech.

    4. He is the first and the last. How shall He cease to number Himself?

    5. By a Magus is this writing made known through the mind of a Magister. The one uttereth clearly, and the other understandeth; yet the Word is falsehood, and the Understanding darkness. And this saying is Of All Truth.

    6. Nevertheless it is written; for there be times of darkness, and this as a lamp therein.

    7. With the Wand createth He.

    8. With the Cup preserveth He.

    9. With the Dagger destroyeth He.

    10. With the Coin redeemeth He.

    11. His weapons fulfil the wheel; and on What Axle that turneth is not known unto Him.

    12. From all these actions must He cease before the curse of His Grade is uplifted from Him. Before He attain to That which existeth without Form.

    13. And if at this time He be manifested upon earth as a Man, and therefore is this present writing, let this be His method, that the curse of His grade, and the burden of His attainment, be uplifted from Him.

    14. Let Him beware of abstinence from action. For the curse of His grade is that He must speak Truth, that the Falsehood thereof may enslave the souls of men. Let him then utter that without Fear, that the Law may be fulfilled. And according to His Original Nature will that law be shapen, so that one may declare gentleness and quietness, being an Hindu; and another fierceness and servility, being a Jew; and yet another ardour and manliness, being an Arab. Yet this matter toucheth the mystery of Incarnation, and is not here to be declared.

    15. Now the grade of a Magister teacheth the Mystery of Sorrow, and the grade of a Magus the Mystery of Change, and the grade of Ipsissimus the Mystery of Selflessness, which is called also the Mystery of Pan.

    16. Let the Magus then contemplate each in turn, raising it to the ultimate power of Infinity. Wherein Sorrow is Joy, and Change is Stability, and Selflessness is Self. For the interplay of the parts hath no action upon the whole. And this contemplation shall be performed not by simple meditation— how much less then by reason? but by the method which shall have been given unto Him in His Initiation to the Grade.

    17. Following which method, it shall be easy for Him to combine that trinity from its elements, and further to combine Sat-Chit-Ananda, and Light, Love, Life, three by three into nine that are one, in which meditation success shall be That which was first adumbrated to Him in the grade of Practicus (which reflecteth Mercury into the lowest world) in Liber XXVII, “Here is Nothing under its three Forms.”

    18. And this is the Opening of the Grade of Ipsissimus, and by the Buddhists it is called the trance Nerodha-Samapatti.

    19. And woe, woe, woe, yea woe, and again woe, woe, woe unto seven times be His that preacheth not His law to men!

    20. And woe also be unto Him that refuseth the curse of the grade of a Magus, and the burden of the Attainment thereof.

    21. And in the word CHAOS let the Book be sealed; yea, let the Book be sealed.

    -- `Liber B vel Magi sub Figura I`_, Aleister Crowley, 1907 AD

    24. I am Nuit, and my word is six and fifty.

    25. Divide, add, multiply, and understand.

    26. Then saith the prophet and slave of the beauteous one, Who am I, and what shall be the sign? So she answered him, bendingdown, a lambent flame of blue, all-touching, all penetrant, her lovely hands upon the black earth, & her lithe body arched for love, and her soft feet not hurting the little flowers: Thou knowest! And the sign shall be my ecstasy, the consciousness of the continuity of existence, the omnipresence of my body.

    27. Then the priest answered & said unto the Queen of Space, kissing her lovely brows, and the dew of her light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling perfume of sweat: O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever thus; that men speak not of Thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at all, since thou art continuous!

    28. None, breathed the light, faint & faery, of the stars, and two.

    29. For I am divided for love's sake, for the chance of union.

    30. This is the creation of the world, that the pain of division is as nothing, and the joy of dissolution all.

    31. For these fools of men and their woes care not thou at all! They feel little; what is, is balanced by weak joys; but ye are my chosen ones.

    32. Obey my prophet! follow out the ordeals of my knowledge! seek me only! Then the joys of my love will redeem ye from all pain. This is so: I swear it by the vault of my body; by my sacred heart and tongue; by all I can give, by all I desire of ye all.

    33. Then the priest fell into a deep trance or swoon, & said unto the Queen of Heaven; Write unto us the ordeals; write unto us the rituals; write unto us the law!

    34. But she said, the ordeals I write not; the rituals shall be half known and half concealed; the Law is for all.

.. epigraph::

    Facing East, in the centre, draw deep deep deep thy breath closing thy mouth with thy right forefinger prest against thy lower lip. Then dashing down the hand with a great sweep back and out, expelling forcibly thy breath, cry APO PANTOS KAKODAIMONOS. With the same forefinger touch thy forehead, and say SOI, thy member, and say O PHALLE, [The secret sense of these words is to be sought in the numeration thereof.], thy right shoulder, and say ISCHUROS, thy left shoulder, and say EUCHARISTOS; then clasp thine hands, locking the fingers, and cry IAÕ. Advance to the East. Imagine strongly a Pentagram, aright, in thy forehead. Drawing the hands to the eyes, fling it forth, making the sign of Horus and roar THÉRION. Retire thine hand in the sign of Hoor-paar-Kraat.

    Go round to the North and repeat; but say NUIT.

    Go round to the West and repeat; but whisper BABALON.

    Go round to the South and repeat; but bellow HADIT.

    Completing the circle widdershins, retire to the centre and raise thy voice in the Paian, with these words IÕ PAN, with the signs of N.O.X.

    Extend the arms in the form of a Tau and say low but clear:
    PRO MOU IUNGES OPICHÕ MOU TELETARCHAI EPI DEXIA CHUNOCHES EPARISTERA DAIMONOS PHEG EI GAR PERI MOU O ASTÉR TÕN PENTE KAI EN TÉI STÉLÉI Õ ASTÉR TÕN EX ESTÉXE.

    Repeat the Cross Qabalistic, as above, and end as thou didst begin.

.. epigraph::

    | Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law
    | Will = direct, straight line (as arrow)
    | Euclid's straight line or right line is the shortest distance between two points. Thus right actually means right. All wrong is indication by definition  --  as in wander, wanton, straight etc. Language itself bears witness to the Law.
    | Wander  --  wanton  --  straight  --  crooked  --  connexion is Euclid's definition of a straight (right) line. Freudian!
    | Wander suggests to our memorie ( . . . ) we read to wander to love.
