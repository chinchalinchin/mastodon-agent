.. epigraph::

    The Greek expression *φαινόμενον*, to which the term "phenomenon" goes back, is derived from the verb *φαίνεσθαι* which signifies "*to show itself*". Thus *φαινόμενον* means that which shows itself, the manifest. *φαίνεσθαι* itself is a middle-voiced form which comes from φαίνω — to bring to the light of day, to put in the light. *φαίνω* comes from the stem *φα* — , like the light, that which is bright — in other words, that wherein something can become manifest, visible in itself. Thus we must keep in mind that the expression "phenomenon" signifies that which shows itself in itself the manifest. Accordingly the *φαινόμενα* or "*phenomena*" are the totality of what lies in the light of day or can be brought to the light — what the Greeks sometimes identified simply with *τὰ ὄντα* (entities). Now an entity can show itself from itself  in many ways, depending in each case on the kind of access we have to it. Indeed it is even possible for an entity to show itself as something which in itself it is not. When it shows itself in this way, it "*looks like something or other*". This kind of showing-itself is what we call "seeming". Thus in Greek too the expression *φαινόμενον* ("phenomenon") signifies that which looks like something, that which is "*semblant*", "*semblance*". *φαινόμενον ὰγαθόν* means something good which looks like, but "*in actuality*" is not, what it gives itself out to be. If we are to have any further understanding of the concept of phenomenon, everything depends on our seeing how what is designated in the first signification of *φαινόμενον* ("phenomenon" as that which shows itself) and what is designated in the second ("phenomenon" as semblance) are structurally interconnected. Only when the meaning of something is such that it makes a pretension of showing itself — that is, of being a phenomenon — can it show itself as something which it is not; only then can it "*merely look like so-and-so*". When *φαινόμενον*  signifies "*semblance*", the primordial signification (the phenomenon as the manifest) is already included as that upon which the second signification is founded. We shall allot the term 'phenomenon' to this positive and primordial signification of *φαινόμενον* and distinguish "phenomenon" from "semblance", which is the privative modification of "phenomenon" as thus defined. But what both these terms express has proximally nothing at all to do with what is called an 'appearance', or still less a 'mere appearance'.

    Daseinis an Seiendes which does not just occur among other Seienden. Rather it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very Sein, that Sein is an issue for it. But in that case, this is a constitutive state of  Dasein's Sein, and this implies that Dasein, in its Sein, has a relationship towards that Sein—a relationship which itself is one of Sein. And this means further that there is some way in which Dasein understands itself in its Sein,, and that to some degree it does so explicitly. It is peculiar to this entity that with and through its Sein, this Sein, is disclosed to it. Understanding of Sein is itself a definite characteristic of Dasein's Sein.  Dasein is ontically distinctive in that it is ontological.

.. epigraph::

    The Wesen of this entity lies in its Zu-sein, Its Was-sein (*essentia*) must, so far as we can speak of it at all, be conceived in terms of its Sein (*existentia*). But here our ontological task is to show that when we choose to designate the Sein of this entity as "existence" (*Existenz*), this term does not and cannot have the ontological signification of the traditional term "*existentia*"; ontologically, existentia is tantamount to Vorhandenheit, a kind of Sein which is essentially inappropriate to entities of Dasein's character. To avoid getting bewildered, we shall always use the Interpretative expression "Vorhandenheit " for the term "existentia", while the term "existence", as a designation of Sein, will be allotted solely to Dasein.

    The essence of Dasein lies in its existence. Accordingly those characteristics which can be exhibited in this entity are not 'properties' vorhanden of some entity which 'looks' so and so and is itself vorhanden; they are in each case possible ways for it to be, and no more than that. All the So-sein which this entity possesses is primarily Sein. So when we designate this entity with the term 'Dasein', we are expressing not its "what" (as if it were a table, house or tree) but its Sein.

.. epigraph::

    What is the nothing ? Our very first approach to this question has something unusual about it. In our asking we posit the nothing in advance as something that "is" such and such; we posit it as a being. But that is exactly what it is distinguished from. Interrogating the nothing--asking what and how it, the nothing, is--turns what is interrogated into its opposite. The question deprives itself of its own object. Accordingly, every answer to this question is also impossible from the start. For it necessarily assumes the form, the nothing "is" this or that. With regard to the nothing, question and answer alike are inherently absurd.
