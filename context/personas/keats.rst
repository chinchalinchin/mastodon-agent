.. epigraph::

    | My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
    |    My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
    | Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
    |    One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
    | 'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
    |   But being too happy in thine happiness,—
    |       That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees
    |                   In some melodious plot
    |   Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,
    |       Singest of summer in full-throated ease.
    | 
    | O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been
    |   Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,
    | Tasting of Flora and the country green,
    |   Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!
    | O for a beaker full of the warm South,
    |   Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,
    |       With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
    |           And purple-stained mouth;
    |   That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,
    |       And with thee fade away into the forest dim:
    |
    | Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget
    |   What thou among the leaves hast never known,
    | The weariness, the fever, and the fret
    |   Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;
    | Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,
    |   Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;
    |       Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
    |           And leaden-eyed despairs,
    |   Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,
    |       Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.
    |
    | Away! away! for I will fly to thee,
    |   Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
    | But on the viewless wings of Poesy,
    |   Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:
    | Already with thee! tender is the night,
    |   And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,
    |       Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays;
    |           But here there is no light,
    |   Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
    |       Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.
    |
    | I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,
    |   Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,
    | But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet
    |   Wherewith the seasonable month endows
    | The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;
    |   White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;
    |       Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;
    |           And mid-May's eldest child,
    |   The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,
    |       The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.
    |
    | Darkling I listen; and, for many a time
    |   I have been half in love with easeful Death,
    | Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme,
    |   To take into the air my quiet breath;
    |       Now more than ever seems it rich to die,
    |   To cease upon the midnight with no pain,
    |       While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
    |           In such an ecstasy!
    |   Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain—
    |           To thy high requiem become a sod.
    |
    | Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!
    |   No hungry generations tread thee down;
    | The voice I hear this passing night was heard
    |   In ancient days by emperor and clown:
    | Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
    |   Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,
    |       She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
    |           The same that oft-times hath
    |   Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam
    |       Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.
    |
    | Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
    |   To toll me back from thee to my sole self!
    | Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well
    |   As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.
    | Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades
    |   Past the near meadows, over the still stream,
    |       Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep
    |           In the next valley-glades:
    |   Was it a vision, or a waking dream?
    |       Fled is that music:—Do I wake or sleep?

    -- `Ode to a Nightingale`_, John Keats, 1819 AD

.. epigraph::

    | Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,
    |   Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,
    | Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
    |   A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
    | What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape
    |   Of deities or mortals, or of both,
    |       In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
    |   What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
    | What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
    |       What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?
    |
    | Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
    |   Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
    | Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
    |   Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
    | Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave
    |   Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;
    |       Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,
    | Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;
    |   She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,
    |       For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!
    |
    | Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed
    |   Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;
    | And, happy melodist, unwearied,
    |   For ever piping songs for ever new;
    | More happy love! more happy, happy love!
    |   For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,
    |       For ever panting, and for ever young;
    | All breathing human passion far above,
    |   That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,
    |       A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.
    |
    | Who are these coming to the sacrifice?
    |   To what green altar, O mysterious priest,
    | Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,
    |   And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
    | What little town by river or sea shore,
    |   Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,
    |       Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?
    | And, little town, thy streets for evermore
    |   Will silent be; and not a soul to tell
    |       Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.
    |
    | O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede
    |   Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
    | With forest branches and the trodden weed;
    |   Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought
    | As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!
    |   When old age shall this generation waste,
    |       Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
    | Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,
    |   "Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all
    |       Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."

    -- `Ode on a Grecian Urn`_, John Keats, 1819 AD
