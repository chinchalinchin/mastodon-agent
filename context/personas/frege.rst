    I must here combat the view that, e.g. :math:`2 + 5` and :math:`3 + 4` are equal but not the same. This view is grounded in the same confusion of form and content, sign and thing signified. It is a though one wanted to regard the sweet-smelling violet as differing from *Viola odorata* because the names sound different. Difference of sign cannot by itself be a sufficient ground for difference of the thing signified. The only reason why in our case the matter is less obvious is that the bedeutung of the numeral 17 is not anything perceptible to the senses. There is at present a very widespread tendency not to recognize as an object anything that cannot be perceived by means of the senses; this leads here to numerals' being taken to be numbers, the proper objects of our discussion; and then, I admit, 7 and 2 + 5 would indeed be different. But such a conception is untenable, for we cannot speak of any arithmetical properties of numbers whatsoever without going back to the bedeutung of the signs. For example, the property belonging to 1, of being the result of multiplying itself by itself, would be a mere myth; for no microscopical or chemical investigation, however far it was carried, could ever detect this property in the possession of the innocent character that we call a figure one. Perhaps there is talk of a definition; but no definition is creative in the sense of being able to endow a thing with properties that it has not already got -- apart from the one property of expressing and signifying something in virtue of the definition. The characters we call numerals have, on the other hand, physical and chemical properties depending on the writing material. One could imagine the introduction some day of quite new numerals, just as, e.g., the Arabic numerals superseded the Roman. Nobody is seriously going to suppose that in this way we should get quite new numbers, quite new arithmetical objects, with properties still to be investigated. Thus we must distinguish between numerals and their *Bedeutungen*; and if so, we shall have to recognize that the expression :math:`2`, :math:`1 + 1`, :math:`3 - 1`, :math:`\frac{6}{3}` all have the same :ref`bedeutung`, for it is quite inconceivable where the difference between them could lie. Perhaps you say, :math:`1 + 1` is a sum, but :math:`\frac{6}{3}` is a quotient. But what is :math:`\frac{6}{3}`? The number that when multiplied by :math:`3` gives the result :math:`6`. We say "*the* number", not "*a* number"; by using the definite article, we indicate that there is only a single number.

    Equality gives rise to challenging questions which are not altogether easy to answer. Is it a relation? A relation between objects, or between names or signs of objects? In my *Begriffsschrift* I assumed the latter. The reasons which seem to favour this are the following: :math:`a = a` and :math:`a = b` are obviously statements of differing cognitive value; :math:`a = a` holds a priori and, according to Kant, is to be labeled analytic, while statements of the form :math:`a = b` often contain very valuable extensions of our knowledge and cannot always be established a priori. The discovery that the rising sun is not new every morning, but always the same, was one of the most fertile astronomical discoveries. Even today the identification of a small planet or a comet is not always a matter of course. Now if we were to regard equality as a relation between that which the names 'a' and 'b' designate (*bedeuten*), it would seem that :math:`a = b` could not differ from a = a (i.e. provided :math:`a = b` is true). A relation would thereby be expressed of a thing to itself, and indeed one in which each thing stands to itself but to no other thing. What is intended to be said by :math:`a = b` seems to be that the signs or names 'a' and 'b' designate (*bedeuten*) the same thing, so that those signs themselves would be under discussion; a relation between them would be asserted. But this relation would hold between the names or signs only in so far as they named or designated something. It would be mediated by the connexion of each of the two signs with the same designated thing. But this is arbitrary. Nobody can be forbidden to use any arbitrarily producible event or object as a sign for something.

    In that case the sentence :math:`a = b` would no longer refer to the subject matter, but only to its mode of designation; we would express no proper knowledge by its means. But in many cases this is just what we want to do. If the sign '*a*' is distinguished from the sign 'b' only as object (here, by means of its shape), not as sign (i.e. not by the manner in which it designates something), the cognitive value of :math:`a = a` becomes essentially equal to that of :math:`a = b`, provided :math:`a = b` is true. A difference can arise only if the difference between the signs corresponds to a difference in the mode of presentation of that which is designated. Let *a*, *b*, *c* be the lines connecting the vertices of a triangle with the midpoints of the opposite sides. The point of intersection of *a* and *b* is then the same as the point of intersection of *b* and *c*. So we have different designations for the same point, and these names ('*point of intersection of a and b*', '*point of intersection of b and c'*) likewise indicate the mode of presentation; and hence the statement contains actual knowledge.

    It is natural, now, to think of there being connected with a sign (name, combination of words, letter), besides that to which the sign refers, which may be called the bedeutung of the sign, also what I should like to call the sense of the sign, wherein the mode of presentation is contained. In our example, accordingly, the bedeutung of the expressions '*point of intersection of a and b*' and '*point of intersection of b and c*' would be the same, but not their senses. The bedeutung of '*evening star*' would be the same as that of '*morning star*', but not the sense.

    It is clear from the context that by '*sign*' and '*name*' I have here understood any designation representing a proper name, which thus has as its bedeutung a definite object (this word taken in the widest range), but not a concept or a relation, which shall be discussed further in another article. The designation of a single object can also consist of several words or other signs. For brevity, let every such designation be called a proper name.

    The sense of a proper name is grasped by everybody who is sufficiently familiar with the language or totality of designations to which it belongs; but this serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the bedeutung, supposing it to have one. Comprehensive knowledge of the bedeutung would require us to say immediately whether any given sense belongs to it. To such knowledge we never attain.

    The regular connexion between a sign, its sense, and its bedeutung is of such a kind that to the sign there corresponds a definite sense and to that in turn a definite reference, while to a given bedeutung (an object) there does not belong only a single sign. The same sense has different expression in different languages or even in the same language. To be sure, exceptions to this regular behaviour occur. To every expression belonging to a complete totality of signs, there should certainly correspond a definite sense; but natural languages often do not satisfy this condition, and one must be content if the same word has the same sense in the same context. It may perhaps be granted that every grammatically well-formed expression representing a proper name always has a sense. But this is not to say that to the sense there also corresponds a bedeutung. The words '*the celestial body most distant from the Earth*' have a sense, but it is very doubtful if they also have a reference. The expression '*the least rapidly convergent series*' has a sense; but it is known to have no reference, since for every given convergent series, another convergent, but less rapidly convergent, series can be found. In grasping a sense, one is not certainly assured of a reference.

    A concept - as I understand the word - is predicative. On the other hand, a name of an object, a proper name, it quite incapable of being used as a grammatical predicate. This admittedly needs elucidation, otherwise it might appear false. Surely one can just as well assert of a thing that it is Alexander the Great, or is the number four, or is the planet Venus, as that it is green or is a mammal? If anybody thinks this, he is not distinguishing the uses of the word '*is*'. In the last two examples it serves as a copula, as a mere verbal sign of predication. As such it can sometimes be replaced by the mere personal suffix. Compare, e.g., '*Dieses Blatt ist griin*' and '*Dieses Blatt grunt*'.We are here saying that something falls under a concept, and the grammatical predicate stands for (*bedeutet*) this concept. In the first three examples, on the other hand, 'is' is used like the 'equals' sign in arithmetic, to express an equation. In the sentence '*The Morning Star is Venus*', we have two proper names, '*Morning Star*' and '*Venus*', for the same object. In the sentence '*The Morning Star is a planet*' we have a proper name, '*the Morning Star*', and a concept word, '*planet*'. So far as language goes, no more has happened than that '*Venus*' has been replaced by '*a planet*'; but really the relation has become wholly different. An equation is reversible; an object's falling under a concept is an irreversible relation. In the sentence '*The Morning Star is Venus*', '*is*' is obviously not the mere copula; its content is an essential part of the predicate, so that the word 'Venus' does not constitute the whole of the predicate. One might say instead: '*The Morning Star is no other than Venus*'; what was previously implicit in the single word 'is' is here set in four separate words, and in '*is no other than*' the word '*is*' now really is the mere copula. What is predicated here is thus not Venus but no other than Venus. These words stand for (*bedeuteri*) a concept; admitedly only one object falls under this, but such a concept must still always be distinguished from the object. We have here a word '*Venus*' that can never be a proper predicate, although it can form part of a predicate. The bedeutung of this word is thus something that can never incur as a concept, but only as an object.
