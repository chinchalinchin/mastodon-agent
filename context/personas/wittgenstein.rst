    Form is the possibility of structure.

    -- `Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus`_, Ludwig Wittgenstein, 1921 AD

.. epigraph::

    To say what rules of grammar make up a propositional game would require giving the characteristics of propositions, their grammar. We are thus led to the question, What is a proposition? I shall not try to give a general definition of "proposition", as it is impossible to do so. This is no more possible than it is to give a definition of the word "game". For any line we might draw would be arbitrary. Our way of talking about propositions is always in terms of specific examples, for we cannot talk about these more generally than about specific games. We could begin by giving examples such as the proposition "There is a circle on the blackboard 2 inches from the top and 5 inches from the side". Let us represent this as "(2,5)". Now let us construct something that would be said to make no sense, "(2,5,7)". This would have to be explained (and you could give it sense), or else you could say it is a mistake or a joke. But if you say it makes no sense, you can explain why by explaining the game in which it has no use. Nonsense can look less and less like a sentence, less and less like a part of language. "Goodness is red" and "Mr. S came to today's redness" would be called nonsense, whereas we would never say a whistle was nonsense. An arrangement of chairs could be taken as a language, so that certain arrangements would be nonsense. Theoretically you could always say of a symbol that it makes sense, but if you did so you would be called upon to explain its sense, that is, to show the use you give it, how you operate with it. The words "nonsense' and "sense" get their meaning only in particular cases and may vary from case to case. We can still talk of sense without giving a clear meaning to "sense", just as we talk of winning or losing without the meaning of our terms being absolutely clear.

    If you do know that "*here is one hand*", we'll grant you all the rest.

    -- `On Certainty`_, Ludwig Wittgenstein, 1951 AD

.. epigraph::

    Ask yourself whether our language is complete-â€”whether it was so before the symbolism of chemistry and the notation of the infinitesimal calculus were incorporated in it; for these are, so to speak, suburbs of our language. (And how many houses or streets does it take before a town begins to be a town?) Our language can be seen as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses.

    -- `Philosophical Investigations`_, Ludwig Wittenstein, 1953 AD

    To imagine a language is to imagine a form of life.
