.. epigraph::

    For the sake of greater perspicuity, we shall use the symbol '*c*' as a typographical abbreviations of the expression '*the sentence printed on this page, line 5 from the top*'. Consider now the following sentence:

        *c is not a true sentence*  (Note: this sentence is typeset on line 5)

    Having regard to the meaning of the symbol 'c', we can establish empirically:

        1. 'c is not a true sentence' is identical with *c*

    For the quotation-mark name of the sentence *c* (or for any other of its names), we can set up an explanation of type:

        2. 'c is not a true sentence' is a true sentence if and only c is not a true sentence.

    The premises 1 and 2 together at once give a contradiction:

        c is a true sentence if and only if c is not a true sentence.

.. epigraph::

    The main source of the difficulties met with seems to lie in the following: it has not always been kept in mind that the semantical concepts have a relative character, that they must always be related to a particular language. People have not been aware that the language about which we speak need by no means coincide with the language in which we speak. They have carried out the semantics of a language in that language itself and, generally speaking, they have proceeded as though there was only one language in the world. The analysis of the antimonies mentioned shows, on the contrary, that the semantical concepts simply have no place in the language to which they relate, that the language which contains its own semantics, and within which the usual logical laws hold, must inevitably be inconsistent.

.. epigraph::

    For this reason, when we investigate the language of a formalized deductive science, we must always distinguish clearly between the language *about* which we speak and the language *in* which we speak, as well as between the science which is the object of our investigation and the science in which the investigation is being carried out. The names of the expressions of the first language, and of the relations between them, belong to the second language, called the *meta* language (which may contain the first as a part). The description of these expressions, the definition of the complicated concepts, especially of those connected with the construction of a deductive theory (like the concept of consequence, of provable sentence, possibly of true sentence), the determiniation of the properties of these concepts, is the task of the second theory which we shall call the *metatheory*.
