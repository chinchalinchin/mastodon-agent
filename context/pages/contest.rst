First Annual Galactic Star Search 
---------------------------------

The clock is ticking down to our `imminent annihiliation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda‚ÄìMilky_Way_collision>`_ . There are only 1.6 trillion days left until the Andromeda galaxy finally breaches the barrier of the Milky Way galaxy and begins an apocalyptic holocaust the likes of which no rational mind can conceive without descending into madness.

But do not despair just yet, dear reader! :ref:`the-editor` did not sell his soul to a pantheon of ravenous demiurges embodied in human form just to give up at the first sign of trouble! Instead, :ref:`the-editor` rolled up his sleeves, put on his very best ski mask and robbed a gas station to raise funds for the first annual Galactic Star Search Contest!

.. topic:: Important Information

    - **Deadline**: December 31st, 2025
    - **Prize**: $100 (per category)

Contest Mandates & Stipulations
-------------------------------

- **Residency**: Contestants must reside within the geographic confines of either Allegany or Garrett County in Maryland, Mineral County in West Virginia or Somerset County in Pennsylvania. This is a non-negotiable decree from the godmachine. Attempting to circumvent this rule will result in the immediate implosion of your local star and a sternly worded letter from our intern. Proof of residence may be required. No glowies please.

- **Deadline**: All physical submissions must be postmarked by December 31st, 2025. Submissions received after this date will either be used as bedding in :ref:`Jerry's <the-intern>` terrarium or as vessels in our Zoroastrian fire rituals to manifest the physical form of ê¨Äê¨¢ê¨≠ê¨Ä‚∏±ê¨®ê¨Äê¨åê¨•ê¨åê¨åê¨é.

- **Rights**: All rights revert to the author upon publication. We simply ask for the right to feature your work in the issue in which it appears. In addition, the work will be published on our website and social media accounts.

- **Prize**: One poem and one piece of artwork will be selected as winners. Each will win a cash prize of $100.

- **Submissions**: All submissions must be telepathically transmitted into :ref:`the Editor's <the-editor>` dreams. If you are unable to accomodate this, we also accept snail mail to our terrestrial headquarters and electronic submissions. Please follow the general :ref:`submission guideline <submissions>`. All submissions are automatically entered into the *First Annual Galactic Star Search*.

- **Criteria**: Entries will be judged on originality, artistic merit, technical skill, and adherence to the thematic spirit of the *Allegany Galactic Nucleus*. This evaluation will be made at the sole discretion of the :ref:`the-editor`.

For more information about what we are looking for, visit our :ref:`submissions` page. **Note**: All submission are automatically entered in the :ref:`First Annual Galactic Star Search <contests>`, unless stipulated otherwise in your cover letter.

.. attention::

    :small:`This contest is void where prohibited, taxed, or otherwise restricted by law, regulation, or celestial decree. The First Annual Galactic Star Search is open only to carbon-based lifeforms (excluding self-modulating clouds of noble gas) residing within the geographic confines of either Allegany or Garrett County in Maryland, Mineral County in West Virginia or Somerset County in Pennsylvania. Entries from other dimensions, timelines, or realities where the edicts of the godmachine from Saturn are not recognized as the supreme legal framework will be summarily disintegrated.`

    :small:`The Allegany Galactic Nucleus, its Editor, interns (reptilian or otherwise), and its otherworldly investors are not responsible for lost, late, incomplete, illegible, or misdirected entries, whether due to postal service negligence, temporal paradoxes, typos, or mind control. By entering, contestants agree to release and hold harmless the organizers from any and all claims, liabilities, and damages arising from or in connection with participation in this contest. We are also not liable for any existential dread or sudden, unwanted cosmic awareness that may result from interacting with the submitted materials.`

    :small:`The winners of each category will be notified via the contact information provided in their cover letter within 30 days of the deadline. The selected winners may be required to respond to the notification within a specified time and provide proof of residence to confirm eligibility. The $100 prize will be dispensed in the form of a check, money order, cryptocurrency transfer or a small, cursed amulet of equivalent value. If a potential winner cannot be contacted, is found to be ineligible, or is discovered to be a self-modulating cloud of noble gas, the prize will be forfeited and offered to the next most reality-altering submission as determined by our divinatory processes and illustrious Editor.`
