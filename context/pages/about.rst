The *Allegany Galactic Nucleus* is a fledgling starship attempting to chart the unknown regions of the universe with an engine powered exclusively by the sweet-scented propellant of creativity. We publish art pieces and poetry that tap into the primordial aether and transmute it into pure combustion. We desire to paint the sky with the incandescence of your chemtrails.

In June 2025, while he was en route to the Interzone on a mission for the Mossad, a godmachine hidden in the rings of Saturn beamed a transmission via a pink laser directly into our Editor's cerebral cortex. This message informed him, in no uncertain terms, that in four and a half billion years, the Andromeda galaxy would begin colliding with the Milky Way galaxy, destroying all life in the universe in a spasmodic eruption of celestial rapture. However, the godmachine told him there was one (*and only one*) way to alter the course of fate and avert this senseless tragedy: publish a poetry and arts magazine in Western Maryland. 

The theophanous tenacles of the Saturnine crystal left an indeliable mark on our Editor as its prehensile appendages stretched across time and space with pulsating threads of immaculate revelation. At that exact moment, he gave up his life of clandestine operations and committed himself to the pursuit of poetry and art. 

Many people have seen the Editor, but no one can remember exactly what he looks like. Some theories claim he is actually an antinode of the universal harmonic, while others claim his existence is simply a result of the `Mandela Effect <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#Mandela_effect>`_. The general consensus among the informed regards these theories as evidence of a vast psyop designed to mask his true identity.

Due to the unexpected resonance of the pink laser transmission with the Earth's electromagnetic fields, a race of ancient subterranean reptilians, who have been lurking in the molten mantle that guards the planet's core since their exile from the surface ten thousand years ago, were suddenly alerted. They sent an emissary, a wise and storied warrior bearing the legendary ancestral name of *Tz'ikin Xa kachamanik* (:small:`human pronounciation: Jerry`), to the surface to investigate the long-prophesized event. The Editor immediately hired him to read through the slush pile of *AGN*. After a lengthy contract negotiation, he agreed to be paid in apple slices and dead flies. 

Jerry identifies as transdimensional. You may often find him sticking to the side of office buildings, phase-shifting between timelines. Do not be alarmed; he is harmless and merely yearns for the warmth of a long forgotten sun.

In order to secure the necessary funds to start the *Allegany Galactic Nucleus*, the Editor met with a secret organization of Masonic Kabalists in Davos, Switzerland. They demanded several goats, his eternal damnation and 51% equity in the magazine in exchange for $15,000 and a printing press. After begrudgingly acceding to their Faustian bargain, the Editor returned home to start the magazine. The investors sent a representative, :redacted:`𐌰𐌽𐌲𐍂𐌰 𐌼𐌰𐌹𐌽𐍅𐌿`, to join him and oversee the operations of *AGN*.

:redacted:`𐌰𐌽𐌲𐍂𐌰 𐌼𐌰𐌹𐌽𐍅𐌿` is listed as #3 on the Forbes 500 list of richest people in the world (the real list; not the one they publish for public consumption). He sits on the boards of several large multinational conglomerates. 

On his dating profile, :redacted:`𐌰𐌽𐌲𐍂𐌰 𐌼𐌰𐌹𐌽𐍅𐌿` describes himself as an avid John Keats fan and a staunch advocate for human sacrifice.
